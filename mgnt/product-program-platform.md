In software development, **Product, Platform, and Program** serve different but interconnected roles. Hereâ€™s how they differ:

### **1. Product**  
A **product** is a piece of software or a service designed to solve a specific problem or fulfill a user need. It has a lifecycle (from ideation to retirement), a roadmap, and a set of features based on customer requirements.

- **Examples:**  
  - Google Docs (word processor)  
  - Microsoft Teams (communication tool)  
  - Jira (project management tool)

- **Key Characteristics:**  
  - Designed for end-users (internal or external)  
  - Focused on features and usability  
  - Evolving based on customer feedback and market needs  

### **2. Platform**  
A **platform** provides foundational capabilities, services, or infrastructure that other products or applications can build upon. It enables scalability and accelerates product development by offering reusable components.

- **Examples:**  
  - AWS (cloud platform for hosting and computing)  
  - iOS and Android (mobile app platforms)  
  - Kubernetes (container orchestration platform)  

- **Key Characteristics:**  
  - Serves multiple products or services  
  - Provides APIs, SDKs, or services for integration  
  - Focused on scalability, stability, and extensibility  

### **3. Program**  
A **program** is a coordinated effort that consists of multiple related projects, often aligned with strategic business objectives. It ensures different teams or projects work toward a common goal, typically at an organizational level.

- **Examples:**  
  - A **digital transformation program** that includes projects for modernizing legacy systems, introducing AI, and improving customer experience  
  - A **cybersecurity program** consisting of multiple security-related initiatives  

- **Key Characteristics:**  
  - Oversees multiple projects or products  
  - Ensures alignment with strategic goals  
  - Focused on governance, coordination, and resource management  

### **How They Relate to Each Other:**  
- A **Platform** supports multiple **Products** (e.g., AWS hosting various SaaS applications).  
- A **Program** may oversee multiple **Products** (e.g., an enterprise software suite).  
- A **Product** can use a **Platform** (e.g., Netflix using AWS for cloud infrastructure).
